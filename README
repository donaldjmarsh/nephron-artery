This code was developed for use on a Debian version of Linux.  The code is written in Fortran 90, using gnufortran and
openMPI.  Use Makefile to compile and link the code. The program runs on 11 microprocessors.  The executable file 'go'
will run 15 versions of the program each using an unique seed for the random number processor.  Bear in mind that different
microprocessors may generate different results with the random number processor.
