These programs were written in Fortran95 to simulate responses of 10 nephrons to changes in arterial blood pressure.  They were executed on a machine using the Debian version of linux. The MPI message passing interface is required.  The files input.dat, inputash.dat,
inputash.dat, tgfchl.dat, and tgfpq.dat contain program parameters and initial conditions. 
The code is assembled and linked with the executable file Makefile. A series of 7 runs can be run with the executable go.  The 7 files inputsys-*-321.dat contain arterial lengths and initial radii, the root arterial blood pressure, and the job sequence
number, in this case 321.
